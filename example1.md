## Paragraphs
<hr />
On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.<br />
On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer near the city of Los Angeles.
## Headings
<hr />
adding '#' symbols before your heading text. The number of '#' you use will determine the size of the heading.
##Blockquotes
<hr />
In the words of Abraham Lincoln: 
>Pardon my french
##Styling text
<hr />
*This text will be italic*<br />
**This text will be bold**<br />
Both boldand italic can use either a '*' or an '_' around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed.<br />
**Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**
## List
<hr />
### Unordered lists
* Item
- Item
###Ordered lists
1. Item1
2. Item2
3. Item3
###Nested lists(some problem)
You can create nested lists by indenting list items by two spaces.

1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3

## Code formatting
<hr />
### Inline formats
Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.
###Multiple lines
Check out this neat program I wrote:
```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```

##Links
***
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in backets ('[]'), and then wrapping the link in parenthesis ('()').
